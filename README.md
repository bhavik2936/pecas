[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fastruby/pecas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fastruby/pecas)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fastruby/pecas/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fastruby/pecas)

Pecas is a time tracking leaderboard for
[https://nokotime.com](https://nokotime.com).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems running the setup script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fastruby/pecas.git
cd pecas
./bin/setup
```

## Environment Variables

The command `./bin/setup`, among other things, creates the `.env` file which contains the following env variables:

```yml
# .env.sample
NOKO_ACCOUNT_HOST=ombulabs
NOKO_TOKEN=foobar
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_DOMAIN=ombushop.com
SMTP_USER_NAME=ernesto@ombushop.com
SMTP_USER_PASSWORD=secret
COUNTRY_CODE="ar"
DATABASE_NAME="pecas"
BASIC_AUTH_NAME="user"
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="secret"
```

Now, you just need to update the `NOKO_TOKEN` env with the correct value.
You can fetch the token value from the Noko app, after logging in, you can find the `API token` or create a new one under the `Connected Apps > Noko API > Personal Access Tokens` section.

The `BASIC_AUTH_NAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` are already setup from the `.env.sample` file but you can change their values at any time, will be used for a basic http auth for the application.

## Slack Notifications

If you want to use Pecas to send Slack messages you'll also need to setup
`SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the `.env` file. This requires a `SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN`
generated with the following scopes:

* chat:write
* usergroups:read
* users.profile:read
* users:read
* users:read.email

Once set up we can use the rake task `notify:send_noko_format_warning['<name of slack group to alert>']`.
This task is desined to be run once an hour (for best results - a few minutes
after the hour) as it will only notify users Slack reports as being in the
timezone currently within an hour of 8pm.

## Start

You can setup your `COUNTRY_CODE` environment variable with an ISO 3166 country code.
Otherwise the emails will be sent on holidays.

## Starting the Server

```bash
rails s
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and start your session with the `BASIC_AUTH_NAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` values.

## Running Tests

```bash
rspec
```
